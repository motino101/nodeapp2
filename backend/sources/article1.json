    "content": "so, how does a gradener tend for COMMUNITY? Gardeners do this. important bc ___ #### i. community one of the most important things I've learned from making [content](https://www.instagram.com/covacut/) online is that there's a profound difference between views and community. views are raw eyeballs; the number of people who see something. community is something else entirely. to a content creator like me, it's demographics in a spreadsheet. to cluely; it's something i've been thinking about. an AI isn't able to make community. you have farmers like creators where community doesn't matter. its purely eduaction. AI. (AI-educator) and then you have RPN, a creator I really love. telling stories that matter. mental health. truly internets dad. for me, my online community is the young women, 18-35, who see in me someone who has walked in their shoes: someone who followed the prescriptive path in computer science but yearned to create something beautiful. they make videos in my style, they connect with my music, they understand the tension between technical precision and creative expression. there's something profound about cultivating relationships with people who look to you as a guide, who see your work and think yes, this person gets it. When was the last time you felt that spark of genuine connection online? That moment when someone's comment or message made you realize they truly understood what you were trying to express? This is what views without community feels like: empty calories for the creator's soul. yet community is what keeps creators creating. it's what gives us joy and purpose. when your community isn't aligned with who you actually are—when the algorithm delivers the wrong audience—it sucks the joy completely out of creating. I realized this when I started inadvertently cultivating a male tech audience that was fundamentally misaligned with my creative vision. The numbers looked good, but the fulfillment vanished. Have you experienced this misalignment? The strange emptiness of being popular with people who don't really see you? community is difficult to quantify, yet it's the most valuable metric in an age of synthetic engagement. it looks like comments, or shares, or messages from a young woman who is very like me 2 years ago who wants to walk in my shoes; it wWhen Julia shared how my work inspired her creative experiments was one recent delight. the best thing is when my work inspires awesome work. community comes from making people feel something, over time, in different ways. i track it through: 1. the quality of comments 2. the demographics that align with my vision of who i want my message to reach 3. the ripple effect of my work -> how many ypeople have taken action? comments/ reshares, or redos. I use my taste, my authentic voice, my genuine experiences to develop my community. That's a garden right there. And I'm part of others' gardens too. This is my response to the dark forest: instead of shouting into the void hoping for views, I'm cultivating a space where genuine human creativity and connection can flourish. followers mean nothing without community. AI can cultivate views but not community. can you connect with someone going through the same struggle? no. this explains why creators can have millions of views but no meaningful comments, why demographics get skewed toward audiences that don't align with their vision, why building on certain platforms feels like pruning thorns while others feel like tending flowers. the biggest challenge every creator faces isn't going viral. it's building genuine community. who do I represent to people? why does my YouTube audience, even if it's 10x smaller than Instagram, feel 10x more fulfilling? because community is an intangible that makes creative work worthwhile. #### ii. taste a distinction that becomes even more critical as we navigate this AI-saturated landscape."
